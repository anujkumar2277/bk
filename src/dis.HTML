Gaming can be very fun and has some advantages to it, but there are disadvantages.
 In all my years of gaming I have found that these disadvantages don't stop me from 
 enjoying a good game, though. Some of the disadvantages to gaming are obvious,
 while others aren't as well known.
Things like your eyesight. If you are really close to a screen while you are playing,
 you may begin to notice that your vision is more blurry than it was before you 
 started playing. Keep in mind, though that this would be a long term effect of 
 gaming. However, if you are glued to a screen for a few hours and then try to 
 look at something else, your vision might be blurry, but then as you focus it
 will return to your regular vision. This, added up, could lead to you needing
 glasses or contacts to help you.
Another common disadvantage is time. As you become more and more engrossed in
 gaming, you may lose track of time (I know I have….Fallout 4 is to blame).
 This could cause problems in the long run with your social life. Friends 
 that may not be as interested in gaming as you are might wonder why you don't
 spend as much time with them (this usually only becomes a big problem if you 
 spend a LOT of time gaming). Your family may not like that you don't spend more
 time with them, either. It becomes worse if you have a family/kids to take care
 of. If you spend the majority of your time gaming, you aren't spending the time
 with your kids or significant other that they need/like.
Your money might start to “disappear” with the more time you spend gaming. 
I've separated this into two parts since there is more than one way for you to
 spend a lot of money to play games.
