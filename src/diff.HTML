Reasons to buy digital games
They're incredibly convenient. You can buy and install digital games from 
your console or PC without even leaving the couch. Plus, many digital games 
can be "pre-loaded" once you've pre-ordered them, meaning the entire game
 will be downloaded and ready to go the second its release date hits. You 
 can even buy digital games via the PlayStation and Xbox mobile apps and have
 them installed and waiting for you by the time you get home.
You'll never lose them. Physical media is nice and all, but it can be
 lost, stolen, or — if you have pets or small children — destroyed. Meanwhile,
 your digital games are stored safely in the cloud, and can typically be deleted 
 and re-installed on any console or PC that your Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo 
 or Steam account is connected to.
You get to enjoy cross-buy. Certain digital games can be bought once and played
 across multiple platforms, which makes ditching physical games incredibly
 appealing. For example, Xbox Play Anywhere titles such as Gears of War 4, 
 Middle-Earth: Shadow of War and Cuphead can be bought once and played 
 across Xbox One and PC. Same goes for PlayStation titles such as Darkest
 Dungeon and Super Meat Boy, which you can enjoy across your PS4 and PS Vita.

Reasons to buy physical games
You can sell them back. While you're stuck with digital purchases forever, 
physical games can be sold back to places like GameStop, Best Buy and Amazon 
once you're done with them. You likely won't get all of your money back, 
but you will get some cash to put toward that next big game on your list.
You can lend and borrow them. Want your friend to see how amazing the new
 Call of Duty or Assassin's Creed game is? It's a lot easier to hand over
 your copy than it is to go to their place and install it from the cloud.
 Also, believe it or not, game rental services still exist. Places like 
 GameFly and Redbox let you try before you buy, and in some cases, keep 
 whatever games you like for an extra fee.
Discounts are more frequent. While both digital and physical games go on
 sale often, you'll typically find the best discounts on physical games.
 Amazon Prime members get 20 percent off new physical releases, as do folks
 with a Best Buy Gamers Club account. Going physical also gives you the
 option to buy pre-owned games, which are usually at least a few bucks 
 cheaper than new copies.
You can show off your collection. Sure, going digital saves you shelf 
space, but for some people, collecting physical game boxes is half the fun.
 If you want to have a physical collection you can pass down to a child or
 loved one, it sure would be a lot nicer giving them a stack of actual 
 games instead of the login to your Xbox Live account.
